#To Do
To Do list for everyone

#Group tasks:
* (RC, EB) Formulate questions for Prof. about analytical methods (regression vs. other methods).
* (SG) Work on SQL queries for random selections (contingent on either database or SQL/csv wrapper). 
* (All or someone could volunteer to take lead getting started) Start the Presentation outline (https://github.com/stat4701-edav-gps/presentation) - can be edited inline via GitHub website. Edit README.md file.  
* (All or someone could volunteer to take lead on scheduling) Figure out which day/time/place for weekend of April 25-26. 
* Perhaps we should include some kind of interactive component to the project - discuss at next meeting
 * Good idea!

These Other Group tasks will likely need to be broken out in to smaller steps for individual members.
